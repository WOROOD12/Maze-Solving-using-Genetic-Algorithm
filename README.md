# Maze-Solving-using-Genetic-Algorithm


This project solves large mazes (100x100 and 200x200) using a customized Genetic Algorithm built with pymoo.

## How to Run
- Install dependencies: `pip install pymoo matplotlib pandas`
- Run the script: `python ga_maze.py`
- Ensure maze files are placed in the same directory.

## Files
- ga_maze.py
- maze_100x1002.txt
- maze_200x2002.txt
- images/*.png
